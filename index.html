Unlike the Romans, the Jews believed that GOD was the only god. Some Romans thought that the Jews were insulting Rome’s gods by not praying to them. Still the Romans allowed the Jews to practice their religion and not banning it. It was not until later when political conflict arose with the Jews that the Romans decided to take action. Political conflict rse when Jews started to rebel against the Romans. Judea was conquered by the Romans and the Jews did not like Roman rule. As a result the Jews rebelled. The rebellion was defeated and the Jews were punished for this action. The romans crushed the Jews and destroyed the Jewish Capital. The Romans built a new city out of the ruins and invited settlers from other parts of the empire to stay there. Early in the first century AD, before the Jews’ first rebellion against the Romans, what would become a new religion appeared in Judea. It was based of the life teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. At the time that Jesus was born, there were several groups of Jews in Judea. The largest of these groups was very strict in how it practiced Judaism. Members of this group were particularly strict in obeying the laws of Moses. Jews believed that Moses had given them these laws to follow. According to the prophecies, the Jews’ new leader would be a descendent of King David. When he came, he would restore the greatness of David’s ancient kingdom, Israel.The prophets called this leader the Messiah. When the Romans took over Judea in 63 BC, many Jews thought the Messiah would soon appear. Prophets wandered throughout Judea, announcing that the Messiah was coming. The most famous of these prophets was John the Baptist.

 Jesus of Nazareth, the man whom many people believe was the Jewish Messiah, lived at the beginning of the first century AD. Although Jesus was one of the most influential figures in world history, we know relatively little about his life.  Most of what we know about Jesus is contained in the New Testament of the Christian Bible.  The Christian Bible is made up of two parts. The first part, the Old Testament, is largely the same as the Hebrew Bible. It tells the history and ideas of the Hebrew people. The second part, the New Testament, is an account of the life and teachings of Jesus and of the early history of Christianity. Jesus was born in a small town called Bethlehem. During his lifetime, Jesus traveled from village to village spreading his message among the Jewish people. According to the New Testament, Jesus performed many miracles and was later claimed the son of god. Jesus emphasized two main ideas, love God and love other people. He told people that you should also love your enemies and love everyone, not just friends or family. After the Resurrection, the 12 apostles and other people helped spread Christianity. Among these people was a man named Paul. Paul was the the most important figure after Jesus’s death. Paul Traveled widely spreading Christianity throughout the Roman Empire. Later Christianity became one of Rome’s main Religions.

The spread of Christianity was very slow. The Apostles had to travel to every part of the world and the world is huge. It took 500 years for christianity to spread throughout the world. From time to Time Christians faced many challenges from local officials. Some of these officials arrested and even killed many Christians. People who suffer death for there religions are called martyrs. A Few Roman Emperors during 200s and 300s thought that the Christians could cause unrest in the Empire which led to several persecutions. Because their religions was banned Christians were forced to meet in secret. Since there weren’t any leaders for Christians, bishops came and and started to lead the Christians. One of the bishops most important job was leading the Eucharist. It was created to honor the last supper Jesus had with Apostles. By the late 100s Christians were looking to bishops of large cities for guidance. The most honored of all the bishops in Rome was the pope. As christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire, Christian writers read the works of classical writers. One such writer was Augustine of Hippo. When Augustine was a young man he studied the works of Plato and when he became Christian, applied Plato’s ideas to Christian beliefs.His ideas helped shape Christian beliefs for hundreds of years.  At about the same time that Saint Augustine was writing, an event changed the standing of Christians in Rome. The emperor himself became a Christian. That emperor was known as Constantine. Legend says when he was preparing for battle against his rivals he saw a cross in the sky which led him to convert into a Christian. As emperor Constantine removed bans against Christians and clarified Christian teachings. Because of Constantine, Christianity spread even more throughout the Empire and Christians wouldn't have to suffer for practicing Christianity.
