  Unlike the Romans, the Jews believed that GOD was the only god. Some Romans thought that the Jews were insulting Rome’s gods by not praying to them. Still the Romans allowed the Jews to practice their religion and not banning it. It was not until later when political conflict arose with the Jews that the Romans decided to take action. Political conflict rse when Jews started to rebel against the Romans. Judea was conquered by the Romans and the Jews did not like Roman rule. As a result the Jews rebelled. The rebellion was defeated and the Jews were punished for this action. The romans crushed the Jews and destroyed the Jewish Capital. The Romans built a new city out of the ruins and invited settlers from other parts of the empire to stay there.
</br>
Constantine the Great then enacted laws limiting Jews rights. One Christianity became the major religion the Roman Emperors created even more restrictions to limit Jews Rights.

  The origins of Christianity in Jewish messianic prophecies come from jesus christ. Many believed that a new leader would appear among them. He would be known as a messiah, and would be chosen by God to lead them. Jesus Christ was believed to be a messiah. He was born in bethlehem but lived his life in nazareth. He began to travel and teach other people. His teachings would be known as the new testament

  The spread of Christianity was very slow. The Apostles had to travel to every part of the world and the world is huge. It took 500 years for christianity to spread throughout this world. From time to Time Christians faced many challenges from local officials. Some of these officials arrested and even killed many Christians. People who suffer death for there religions are called martyrs. A Few Roman Emperors during 200s and 300s thought that the Christians could cause unrest in the Empire which led to several persecutions. Because their religions was banned Christians were forced to meet in secret. Since there weren’t any leaders for Christians, bishops came and and started to lead the Christians. One of the bishops most important job was leading the Eucharist. 
</br>
It was created to honor the last supper Jesus had with Apostles. By the late 100s Christians were lookingto bishops of large cities for guidence.
